# Beat Service

Beat service will insert/update Transaction Status into Elasticsearch

### [Example](- "Simple Insert and Retrieve")

We should be able to connect to Elasticsearch with [NodeClient](- "setUpClient(#type)").

Then [index a book](- "indexBook()") and [retrieve it](- "#book = retrieveTheBook()"). 

The retrieved book should have name as [book name](- "?=#book.name")
